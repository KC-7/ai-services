Predictive SEO uses machine learning algorithms to anticipate what users are going to search for before they even type their queries. By analyzing search patterns, historical data, and user behavior, AI can predict trends and help businesses create content that matches future demand. Imagine having the ability to produce a blog post or product description just as people are starting to search for it—this is the power of predictive SEO."
